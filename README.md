# Xymon to Slack
This script sends Xymon alerts to a specified slack channel using the Slack API & Bots feature. The alert contains a short message about which service is down, for how long, the full xymon message and a tag for a specific alert group (described below).

# Details
This script takes 1 parameter (channel name, $channel) and sends Xymon alerts/notifications to the specified slack channel. The reason I went with a Bot over Incoming Webhooks was because I plan to add more functionality to the xymon alerts, such as querying the bot for more information about the alert or acknowledging the alerts.

# Prerequisites
- Slack Workspace
- Slack App with the Bots feature & functionality enabled
- Bot User OAuth Access Token
- curl


# Slack Configuration
**Slack App Information & Bot Access Token**
- The Xymon Bot Access Token can be found by logging into your slack workspace and navigating to:
	- https://api.slack.com/
- Then click Your Apps in the top right corner
- Click the appropriate app for your Workspace
- From here you will find information relevant to your app
- To view the Bot Access Token, click on OAuth & Permissions under the Features section
	- _Note: The BOT Use OAuth Access Token is a considered a secret key and should not be placed in public code repositories or client-side code like JavaScript._

**Security & Scope**
- Make sure your app has the following permissions in **Scopes**:
	- chat:write
	- chat:write:customize
	- users:write
- For additional security I recommend configuring the **Restrict API Token Usage** to your WAN IP

# Slack Emojis
In this script I use several emojis not native to slack. I made my own emojis for my use cases. Feel free to make your own & be creative! To add custom emojis in slack go to your Slack Workspace and go to **Settings & administration** > **Customize [workspace name]** > **Add Custom Emoji**
